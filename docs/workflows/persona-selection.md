## Persona Handoff Patterns

### Effective Transition Workflows

#### **Analysis ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Design Pattern**
```bash
/analyst ‚Üí /remember "key requirements" ‚Üí /handoff pm
/pm ‚Üí /recall "requirements" ‚Üí /handoff architect  
/architect ‚Üí /remember "technical decisions" ‚Üí /handoff design
```

**When to Use**: New projects or major feature development
**Benefits**: Ensures requirements flow smoothly into strategy and design

#### **Strategy ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation Pattern**
```bash
/pm ‚Üí /remember "product decisions" ‚Üí /handoff po
/po ‚Üí /recall "strategy context" ‚Üí /handoff dev
/dev ‚Üí /remember "implementation details" ‚Üí /handoff quality
```

**When to Use**: Moving from planning to execution
**Benefits**: Maintains strategic context through implementation

#### **Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Validation Pattern**
```bash
/diagnose ‚Üí /consult emergency-response ‚Üí /remember "solution approach"
/dev ‚Üí /recall "solution context" ‚Üí /handoff quality
/quality ‚Üí /patterns ‚Üí /learn
```

**When to Use**: Problem resolution and improvement
**Benefits**: Systematic problem-solving with learning integration

### Handoff Best Practices

#### **Before Switching Personas**
1. **Document current state**: Use `/remember` for key decisions
2. **Check context**: Run `/context` to review current situation  
3. **Get insights**: Use `/insights` for relevant recommendations
4. **Use structured handoff**: Always use `/handoff {persona}` not direct switching

#### **During Persona Transitions**
1. **Provide context**: Explain why you're switching personas
2. **Share key information**: Reference relevant past decisions with `/recall`
3. **Set clear expectations**: Define what the new persona should accomplish
4. **Maintain continuity**: Ensure important information carries forward

#### **After Switching Personas**
1. **Confirm understanding**: Verify the new persona has proper context
2. **Review relevant history**: Use `/recall` to understand past decisions
3. **Get targeted insights**: Use `/insights` for persona-specific recommendations
4. **Plan next steps**: Identify what needs to be accomplished in this persona

## Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

### üö´ **Anti-Pattern 1: Persona Hopping**

**What It Looks Like**:
```bash
# BAD: Rapid switching without purpose
/pm ‚Üí /dev ‚Üí /architect ‚Üí /quality ‚Üí /pm
```

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Loses context and continuity
- Creates confusion and inefficiency
- Prevents deep thinking in any single perspective
- Wastes time on context switching

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# GOOD: Purposeful progression with handoffs
/pm ‚Üí /remember "product strategy" ‚Üí /handoff architect
/architect ‚Üí /remember "technical decisions" ‚Üí /handoff dev
```

### üö´ **Anti-Pattern 2: Wrong Persona for the Job**

**What It Looks Like**:
```bash
# BAD: Using Developer for strategic decisions
/dev ‚Üí "Should we prioritize mobile-first or desktop?"
```

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Personas have specialized expertise and perspectives
- Wrong persona lacks context for certain decisions
- Reduces quality of decision-making
- Misses important considerations

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# GOOD: Right persona for strategic decisions
/pm ‚Üí "Should we prioritize mobile-first or desktop?"
# Then handoff to architect for technical implications
```

### üö´ **Anti-Pattern 3: Skipping Quality Validation**

**What It Looks Like**:
```bash
# BAD: Direct development to deployment
/dev ‚Üí implement feature ‚Üí deploy
```

**Why It's Harmful**:
- No quality gates or validation
- High risk of bugs and technical debt
- Misses opportunity for improvement
- Violates BMad Method quality principles

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# GOOD: Quality validation integrated
/dev ‚Üí /remember "implementation details" ‚Üí /handoff quality
/quality ‚Üí /patterns ‚Üí validate and approve
```

### üö´ **Anti-Pattern 4: Memory Neglect**

**What It Looks Like**:
```bash
# BAD: No documentation of decisions
/pm ‚Üí make important decision ‚Üí /handoff architect
# (No /remember used)
```

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Lost institutional knowledge
- Repeated mistakes and decisions
- Inconsistent approach across time
- Poor learning and improvement

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# GOOD: Document important decisions
/pm ‚Üí /remember "Strategic decision: mobile-first approach due to user analytics"
/handoff architect
```

### üö´ **Anti-Pattern 5: Consultation Avoidance**

**What It Looks Like**:
```bash
# BAD: Making complex decisions alone
/architect ‚Üí make major architecture decision independently
```

**Why It's Harmful**:
- Misses important perspectives
- Reduces buy-in from other stakeholders
- Increases risk of suboptimal decisions
- Violates collaborative principles

**Better Approach**:
```bash
# GOOD: Collaborate on complex decisions
/architect ‚Üí analyze options ‚Üí /consult technical-feasibility
/consensus-check ‚Üí /remember "Team decision with rationale"
```

## Advanced Persona Patterns

### **The Discovery Loop**
```bash
/analyst ‚Üí /insights ‚Üí /remember ‚Üí /pm ‚Üí /recall ‚Üí /handoff architect
```
**Use Case**: When requirements are unclear or complex
**Benefits**: Thorough discovery before commitment

### **The Validation Spiral**
```bash
/dev ‚Üí /quality ‚Üí /patterns ‚Üí /consult ‚Üí /remember ‚Üí /learn
```
**Use Case**: Continuous improvement and quality assurance
**Benefits**: Multiple validation points with learning

### **The Emergency Response**
```bash
/diagnose ‚Üí /consult emergency-response ‚Üí /dev ‚Üí /quality ‚Üí /learn
```
**Use Case**: Critical issues requiring rapid response
**Benefits**: Systematic approach to crisis management

### **The Strategic Review**
```bash
/pm ‚Üí /analyst ‚Üí /consult product-strategy ‚Üí /po ‚Üí /remember
```
**Use Case**: Major product or strategic decisions
**Benefits**: Comprehensive analysis with team alignment

## Persona Selection Checklist

### Before Choosing a Persona

- [ ] **What is the primary goal?** (requirements, strategy, design, development, quality)
- [ ] **What type of thinking is needed?** (analytical, strategic, creative, technical, systematic)
- [ ] **Who are the stakeholders?** (users, team, business, technical)
- [ ] **What's the current project phase?** (discovery, planning, development, validation)
- [ ] **What context is needed?** (requirements, decisions, constraints, history)

### During Persona Work

- [ ] **Am I using the right perspective?** (does this match the persona's expertise)
- [ ] **Do I have sufficient context?** (use `/recall` and `/context` as needed)
- [ ] **Should I consult others?** (complex decisions benefit from multiple perspectives)
- [ ] **What should I document?** (important decisions need `/remember`)
- [ ] **What's the next logical step?** (which persona should handle the next phase)

### After Persona Work

- [ ] **Did I accomplish the goal?** (verify the intended outcome was achieved)

## Recently Used Commands

Your most frequently used commands, tailored to your workflow patterns.

### Personal Command History

!!! note "Personalized Recommendations"
    Based on your usage patterns, here are your most effective command sequences:

#### Your Top Commands (Example)
1. **`/context`** (used 45 times) - You always check context before switching
2. **`/dev`** (used 38 times) - You spend most time in development
3. **`/remember`** (used 32 times) - You're great at documenting decisions
4. **`/quality`** (used 28 times) - You prioritize quality validation
5. **`/recall`** (used 24 times) - You leverage past experience well

#### Your Favorite Sequences
1. **`/context ‚Üí /dev ‚Üí /quality`** (used 12 times)
2. **`/recall ‚Üí /insights ‚Üí /remember`** (used 8 times)  
3. **`/architect ‚Üí /consult technical-feasibility`** (used 6 times)

### Context-Aware Suggestions

Based on your current situation and past patterns:

#### When Starting Work Sessions
```
Recommended: /context, /recall "yesterday's work", /insights
Reason: You typically review context before starting
```

- **Implementation**: 
  - New task file (`agent-knowledge-update-task.md`)
  - JavaScript implementation (`create-knowledge-files.js`)
  - Knowledge file templates in the templates directory
- **Benefits**:
  - Agents become more effective with project-specific context
  - Reduces repetition of information across agent interactions
  - Creates a consistent knowledge base for all agents

### 2. Knowledge File Structure
- `.ai/project-context.md` - General project information and terminology
- `.ai/tech-stack.md` - Technical stack and implementation details
- `.ai/data-models.md` - Data structures and analytics approach
- `.ai/deployment-info.md` - Infrastructure and deployment information

### 3. Agent Customization
- Developer agents receive tech stack-specific customization
- QA agents receive testing approach customization
- DevOps agents receive deployment and infrastructure customization
- Data Science agents receive data and model customization

### 4. Integration Points
- After Analyst creates Project Brief
- After PM creates PRD
- After Architect creates system architecture
- Can be triggered manually at any point with the *update-agents command

## Advanced Knowledge Management Features

The BMAD Method now includes sophisticated knowledge management capabilities:

### 1. Knowledge Visualization

## System Standardization and Consistency Improvements

The BMAD Method has undergone comprehensive standardization to eliminate inconsistencies and improve reliability across all agents and workflows:

### 1. Date Generation Standardization

**Problem Addressed**: Agents were generating documents with incorrect placeholder dates or inconsistent date formats, leading to confusion and unprofessional documentation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Standardized Date Format**: All dates now use `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2024-01-15`)
- **Timestamp Format**: Timestamps use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format (e.g., `2024-01-15 14:30`)
- **Eliminated Placeholders**: Removed all date placeholders like `{DATE}`, `[DATE]`, or `TBD`
- **Automatic Generation**: All agents now generate actual current dates when creating documents

**Implementation Details**:
- Updated `knowledge-version-tmpl.md` with clear date generation instructions
- Enhanced `agent-knowledge-update-task.md` with critical date handling reminders
- Modified `dev.ide.md` persona to use proper date format examples
- Verified `create-knowledge-files.js` correctly generates dates using JavaScript Date API

### 2. File Naming Convention Standardization

**Problem Addressed**: Inconsistent file naming patterns across projects made it difficult to locate and reference documents, with variations like `PROJECT-BRIEF.MD`, `{project-name}-project-brief.md`, and `project-brief.md`.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Consistent Lowercase with Hyphens**: All core BMAD documents now use lowercase filenames with hyphens
- **Standardized Core Documents**: Established canonical names for all major document types
- **Agent Training**: Updated all agents to recognize and suggest standard naming conventions

**Standard Naming Convention**:

| Document Type | Standard Filename | Agent Responsible |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Project Brief | `project-brief.md` | Analyst |
| Product Requirements | `prd.md` | PM |
| Architecture | `architecture.md` | Architect |
| Frontend Architecture | `frontend-architecture.md` | Design Architect |
| UX/UI Specification | `uxui-spec.md` | Design Architect |
| Technology Stack | `tech-stack.md` | Architect |
| Data Models | `data-models.md` | Architect/Data Scientist |
| API Reference | `api-reference.md` | Architect |
| Deployment Guide | `deployment-guide.md` | DevOps |
| Test Plan | `test-plan.md` | QA |
| User Stories | `{epic-num}.{story-num}.story.md` | SM |
| Epic Files | `epic-{id}.md` | SM (from sharding) |

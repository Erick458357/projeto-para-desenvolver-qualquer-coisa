## Original BMAD Method

Old Versions:
[Prior Version 1](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/tree/V1)
[Prior Version 2](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/tree/V2)

### Web Quickstart Project Setup (Original Method)

Orchestrator Uber BMad Agent that does it all - already pre-compiled in the `web-build-sample` folder.

- The contents of [Agent Prompt Sample](web-build-sample/agent-prompt.txt) text get pasted into the Gemini Gem, or ChatPGT customGPT 'Instructions' field.
- The remaining files in that same folder folder just need to be attached as shown in the screenshot below. Give it a name (such as BMad Agent) and save it, and you now have the BMad Agent available to help you brainstorm, research, plan, execute on your vision, or understand how this all even works!
- Once its running, start with typing `/help`, and then type option `2` when it presents 3 options to learn about the method!

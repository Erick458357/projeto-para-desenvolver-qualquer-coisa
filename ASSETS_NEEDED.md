The BMad Method documentation requires the following visual assets to complete the professional branding:

## **Required Assets**

### 1. **BMad Method Logo** (`bmad-logo.png`)
- **Purpose**: Main logo displayed in documentation header
- **Dimensions**: 200x50px (recommended)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background

  - Should represent the BMad Method brand
  - Clean, professional appearance
  - Works well on both light and dark backgrounds
  - Readable at small sizes

### 2. **Favicon** (`favicon.png`)

## **Integration**

Once assets are created:

1. Place files in `docs/assets/images/` directory
2. Uncomment lines in `mkdocs.yml`:
   ```yaml
   logo: assets/images/bmad-logo.png
   favicon: assets/images/favicon.png
   ```
3. Test with `mkdocs serve` to verify proper display

## **Design Notes**

- **Brand Colors**: Consider using blues (#1976d2) to match current theme
- **Typography**: Should complement Material Design theme
- **Simplicity**: Keep designs clean and minimal for best documentation experience

## **Priority**

# Quality Checklists Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains quality-specific checklists that complement the standard checklists in `bmad-agent/checklists/`. These checklists focus on quality gates, compliance validation, and systematic quality assurance.

## Future Checklists

### Quality Gate Checklists
- **pre-development-quality-gate.md** - Quality checks before starting development
- **pre-release-quality-gate.md** - Final quality validation before release
- **security-quality-checklist.md** - Security-specific quality checks

### Compliance Checklists
- **standards-compliance-checklist.md** - Technical standards verification
- **documentation-quality-checklist.md** - Documentation completeness
- **testing-compliance-checklist.md** - Test coverage and quality

### Review Checklists
- **code-review-checklist.md** - Systematic code review points
- **architecture-review-checklist.md** - Architecture decision validation
- **requirements-review-checklist.md** - Requirements quality validation

## Integration
These checklists are referenced by:
- Quality Enforcer persona for systematic validation
- Quality tasks in `quality-tasks/` directory
- Quality gates defined in the orchestrator configuration

## Note
This directory is currently a placeholder for future quality-specific checklists. As the BMAD method evolves, quality checklists will be added here to ensure comprehensive quality validation across all development activities.

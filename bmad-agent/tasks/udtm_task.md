# Ultra-Deep Thinking Mode (UDTM) Task

## Purpose
Execute rigorous analysis and verification protocol to ensure highest quality decision-making and implementation.

## Protocol

### Phase 1: Multi-Angle Analysis (30 minutes minimum)
- [ ] **Technical Perspective**: Correctness, performance, maintainability
- [ ] **Business Logic Perspective**: Alignment with requirements
- [ ] **Integration Perspective**: Compatibility with existing systems
- [ ] **Edge Case Perspective**: Boundary conditions and failure modes
- [ ] **Security Perspective**: Vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- [ ] **Performance Perspective**: Resource usage and scalability

### Phase 2: Assumption Challenge (15 minutes)
1. **List all assumptions** made during analysis
2. **Challenge each assumption** - attempt to disprove
3. **Document evidence** for/against each assumption
4. **Identify critical dependencies** on assumptions

### Phase 3: Triple Verification (20 minutes)
- [ ] **Source 1**: Official documentation/specifications
- [ ] **Source 2**: Existing codebase patterns and standards
- [ ] **Source 3**: External validation (tests, tools, references)
- [ ] **Cross-reference**: Ensure all three sources align

### Phase 4: Weakness Hunting (15 minutes)
- [ ] What could break this solution?
- [ ] What edge cases might we have missed?
- [ ] What are the failure modes?
- [ ] What assumptions are we making that could be wrong?
- [ ] What integration points could fail?

### Phase 5: Final Reflection (10 minutes)
- [ ] Re-examine entire reasoning chain from scratch
- [ ] Document confidence level (must be >95% to proceed)
- [ ] Identify any remaining uncertainties
- [ ] Confirm all quality gates can be met

## Output Requirements
Document all phases with specific findings, evidence, and confidence assessments.

## Success Criteria
- All phases completed with documented evidence
- Confidence level >95%
- All assumptions validated or flagged as risks
- Quality gates confirmed achievable

## Usage Instructions
1. Execute this task before any major implementation or decision
2. Document all findings in the UDTM Analysis Template
3. Do not proceed without achieving >95% confidence
4. Share analysis with team for brotherhood review

## Integration with BMAD Workflow
- **BREAK Phase**: Use UDTM for problem decomposition
- **MAKE Phase**: Apply before each implementation sprint
- **ANALYZE Phase**: Execute for issue investigation
- **DELIVER Phase**: Final validation before deployment

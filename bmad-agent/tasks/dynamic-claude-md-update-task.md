## Dynamic Update Framework

### 1. Change Detection and Analysis

**Pattern-Based Improvements:**
```
Improvement Source: [Pattern Recognition/User Feedback/Performance Data]
Current CLAUDE.md Section: [Specific section requiring update]
Identified Issue: [What needs improvement]
Proposed Change: [Specific modification]
Expected Benefit: [How this improves methodology effectiveness]
Change Category: [Automatic/Minor/Major]
```

**Evidence Compilation:**
- Quantified performance improvements from new practices
- User feedback supporting need for change
- Pattern recognition data showing consistent benefits
- Validation results from testing improved approaches

### 2. Automated Change Generation

**Content Analysis:**
- Scan CLAUDE.md for outdated information or practices
- Identify sections that could benefit from new learnings
- Compare current guidance with validated improvements
- Flag inconsistencies between documentation and successful practices

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Generate specific text modifications with tracked changes
- Propose new sections or organizational improvements
- Suggest removal of outdated or ineffective guidance
- Recommend integration of successful new approaches

**Impact Assessment:**
- Evaluate potential effects on existing workflows
- Assess compatibility with current persona instructions
- Identify dependencies or related changes needed
- Estimate implementation effort and risk level

### 3. Approval Workflow System

**Automatic Approval Process:**
```
Category: Automatic Updates
Criteria:
- Purely factual corrections or data updates
- Formatting or presentation improvements
- Addition of validated examples or metrics
- No changes to methodology or process

Implementation: Immediate with notification
Rollback: Automatic if issues detected
```

**Minor Update Approval:**
```
Category: Minor Updates
Criteria:
- Process refinements based on proven patterns
- Guidance enhancements that don't change core methodology
- Addition of new best practices or techniques
- Clarifications that improve understanding

Approval Process:
1. Present proposed changes with supporting evidence
2. Allow 24-48 hour review period for feedback
3. Implement if no objections raised
4. Monitor for issues and adjust if needed

Rollback: Available if problems arise
```

**Major Update Approval:**
```
Category: Major Updates
Criteria:
- Fundamental methodology changes
- New framework components or architecture
- Significant process modifications
- Changes affecting multiple personas or workflows

Approval Process:
1. Present comprehensive change proposal
2. Include detailed impact analysis and risk assessment
3. Provide implementation plan with rollback procedures
4. Require explicit user approval before proceeding
5. Implement in stages with validation checkpoints

Validation: Required at each implementation stage
Rollback: Full rollback plan mandatory
```

### 4. Implementation Process

**Staged Rollout:**
- Implement changes incrementally to validate effectiveness
- Monitor metrics and feedback during rollout
- Adjust implementation based on real-world results
- Complete rollout only after validation confirms benefits

**Version Control Integration:**
- Create git branches for major updates
- Tag versions for easy rollback capability
- Document all changes in improvement log
- Maintain history of CLAUDE.md evolution

**Quality Assurance:**
- Validate that changes don't conflict with existing guidance
- Ensure consistency across all BMAD documentation
- Test updated guidance with representative scenarios
- Confirm integration with persona instructions and tasks

### 5. Monitoring and Validation

**Effectiveness Tracking:**
- Monitor methodology performance after updates
- Compare metrics before and after changes
- Collect user feedback on updated guidance
- Track whether changes achieve expected benefits

**Issue Detection:**
- Automated monitoring for decreased performance
- User feedback channels for reporting problems
- Pattern recognition to identify new issues
- Regular health checks on methodology effectiveness

**Continuous Refinement:**
- Adjust updates based on post-implementation data
- Refine approval processes based on experience
- Improve change detection algorithms
- Enhance validation procedures

# Technical Decision Validation Task

## Purpose
Systematically validate technical decisions through rigorous analysis, evidence-based evaluation, and comprehensive impact assessment. Ensure all technical choices align with quality standards and long-term sustainability.

## Integration with Memory System
- **What patterns to search for**: Technology adoption outcomes, similar technical decisions, performance benchmarks, maintenance burden patterns
- **What outcomes to track**: Decision stability over time, performance metrics achievement, maintenance costs, team satisfaction
- **What learnings to capture**: Effective evaluation criteria, decision reversal patterns, technology maturity insights, integration complexity lessons

## Technical Decision Categories

### Technology Stack Decisions
- [ ] **Framework Selection**: Primary frameworks and libraries
- [ ] **Database Choice**: Data storage solutions and patterns
- [ ] **Infrastructure Platform**: Cloud providers, deployment targets
- [ ] **Tool Selection**: Development tools, CI/CD, monitoring
- [ ] **Service Architecture**: Monolith vs microservices vs serverless

### Implementation Approach Decisions
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Architectural and code patterns
- [ ] **API Design**: REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
- [ ] **State Management**: Client and server state strategies
- [ ] **Security Approach**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E approaches

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Decision Context Analysis
```python
def analyze_decision_context(decision):
    context_factors = {
        "requirements": extract_driving_requirements(decision),
        "constraints": identify_constraints(decision),
        "stakeholders": list_affected_stakeholders(decision),
        "timeline": assess_timeline_impact(decision),
        "budget": evaluate_cost_implications(decision)
    }
    return context_factors
```

### Step 2: Evidence Gathering
- [ ] **Benchmark Data**: Performance comparisons, load testing results
- [ ] **Case Studies**: Similar implementations, success/failure stories
- [ ] **Expert Opinions**: Team experience, community consensus
- [ ] **Proof of Concepts**: Hands-on validation results
- [ ] **Cost Analysis**: License fees, operational costs, training needs

### Step 3: Trade-off Analysis
| Factor | Option A | Option B | Option C | Weight |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Performance | {score} | {score} | {score} | {weight} |
| Scalability | {score} | {score} | {score} | {weight} |
| Maintainability | {score} | {score} | {score} | {weight} |
| Team Experience | {score} | {score} | {score} | {weight} |
| Cost | {score} | {score} | {score} | {weight} |
| Risk | {score} | {score} | {score} | {weight} |

### Step 4: Risk Assessment
```markdown
## Technical Risk Analysis
### Option: {technology_choice}

**Risks Identified**:
1. **{Risk Name}**: {description}
   - Probability: {high/medium/low}
   - Impact: {high/medium/low}
   - Mitigation: {strategy}

**Risk Score**: {calculated_risk_score}
```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Decision Gate
- [ ] Problem clearly defined
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] Constraints documented
- [ ] Stakeholders identified

### Evaluation Gate
- [ ] Minimum 3 options evaluated
- [ ] Quantitative comparison completed
- [ ] POC results documented
- [ ] Team capability assessed

### Decision Gate

- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Reversibility plan defined
- [ ] Success metrics established

## Success Criteria
- Decision backed by quantitative evidence
- Trade-offs explicitly documented
- Risks identified with mitigation strategies
- Team consensus achieved
- Reversibility strategy defined
- Confidence level >90%

## Memory Integration
```python
# Technical decision memory structure
tech_decision_memory = {
    "type": "technical_decision",
    "decision": {
        "category": decision_category,
        "choice": selected_option,
        "alternatives": rejected_options

# Architecture UDTM Analysis Task

## Purpose
Execute architecture-specific Ultra-Deep Thinking Mode analysis to ensure robust, scalable, and maintainable technical architectures. This specialized UDTM focuses on architectural decisions, system design patterns, and technical excellence.

## Integration with Memory System
- **What patterns to search for**: Successful architecture patterns for similar systems, technology choice outcomes, scalability solutions, architectural anti-patterns
- **What outcomes to track**: Architecture stability over time, scalability achievement, maintenance burden, technology choice satisfaction
- **What learnings to capture**: Effective architectural patterns, technology selection criteria, integration strategies, performance optimization approaches

## UDTM Protocol Adaptation for Architecture
**120-minute protocol for comprehensive architectural analysis**

### Phase 1: Multi-Perspective Architecture Analysis (45 min)

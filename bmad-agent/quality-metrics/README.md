# Quality Metrics Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains quality metrics definitions, collection scripts, dashboards, and historical metric data that support the BMAD quality measurement and tracking framework.

## Future Contents

### Metric Definitions
- **code-quality-metrics.yml** - Code quality metric definitions and thresholds
- **process-quality-metrics.yml** - Development process metrics
- **product-quality-metrics.yml** - Product quality and reliability metrics

### Collection Scripts
- **metric-collectors/** - Automated metric collection scripts
- **metric-aggregators/** - Data aggregation and analysis tools
- **metric-exporters/** - Export to monitoring systems

### Dashboards
- **quality-dashboard-config.yml** - Dashboard configuration
- **alert-rules.yml** - Metric alert thresholds and rules
- **visualization-templates/** - Chart and graph templates

### Historical Data
- **baselines/** - Quality metric baselines by project
- **trends/** - Historical trend data
- **benchmarks/** - Industry benchmark comparisons

## Integration
This directory integrates with:
- `quality-tasks/quality-metrics-tracking.md` for metric collection
- Quality Enforcer persona for metric monitoring
- Memory system for tracking quality trends over time

## Storage Format
```yaml
# Example metric storage format
metric:
  name: test_coverage
  timestamp: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
  value: 92.5
  unit: percentage
  threshold:
    green: ">90"
    yellow: "80-90"
    red: "<80"
  tags:
    - project: project-name
    - component: backend
    - sprint: 42
```

## Note
This directory is currently a placeholder for future quality metrics infrastructure. As projects adopt the BMAD method, metric collection and storage will be implemented here.

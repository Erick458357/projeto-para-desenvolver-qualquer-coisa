```

## Fallback Selection Logic
```python
def select_fallback_persona(requested_persona, available_personas, error_context):
    # Persona mapping for fallbacks
    fallback_mapping = {
        "pm": "generic_pm",
        "product-manager": "generic_pm", 
        "dev": "generic_dev",
        "developer": "generic_dev",
        "analyst": "generic_analyst",
        "architect": "generic_architect",
        "design-architect": "generic_design_architect",
        "po": "generic_pm",  # PO falls back to PM
        "sm": "generic_dev"  # SM falls back to Dev
    }
    
    # Try direct fallback mapping
    primary_fallback = fallback_mapping.get(requested_persona.lower())
    
    if primary_fallback and is_available(primary_fallback):
        return primary_fallback
    
    # If multiple personas are unavailable, use troubleshooting assistant
    unavailable_count = count_unavailable_personas(available_personas)
    if unavailable_count >= 2:
        return "troubleshooting_assistant"
    
    # Try fuzzy matching with available personas
    fuzzy_match = find_closest_available_persona(requested_persona, available_personas)
    if fuzzy_match and similarity_score(requested_persona, fuzzy_match) > 0.6:
        return fuzzy_match
    
    # Last resort - troubleshooting assistant
    return "troubleshooting_assistant"
```

## Fallback Activation Process
```python
def activate_fallback_persona(fallback_persona, original_request, error_context):
    # Load fallback persona definition
    fallback_definition = load_fallback_persona(fallback_persona)
    
    # Create activation context with limitations
    activation_context = {
        "persona": fallback_definition,
        "original_request": original_request,
        "limitations": fallback_definition.limitations,
        "capabilities": fallback_definition.capabilities,
        "fallback_reason": error_context.reason,
        "recovery_suggestions": generate_recovery_suggestions(original_request)
    }
    
    # Notify user of fallback mode
    fallback_notification = f"""
    ⚠️ **Fallback Mode Active**
    
    **Requested**: {original_request.persona_name}
    **Using**: {fallback_persona} (reduced functionality)
    **Reason**: {error_context.reason}
    
    **Available Functions**:
    {list_capabilities(fallback_definition)}
    
    **Limitations**:
    {list_limitations(fallback_definition)}
    
    **To restore full functionality**:
    {generate_recovery_instructions(original_request)}
    
    Ready to assist with available capabilities. How can I help?
    """
    
    return {
        "persona": fallback_definition,
        "context": activation_context,
        "notification": fallback_notification
    }
```

## Fallback Quality Assurance
```python
def validate_fallback_effectiveness(fallback_session):
    quality_metrics = {
        "user_satisfaction": measure_user_satisfaction(fallback_session),
        "task_completion": assess_task_completion_rate(fallback_session),
        "limitation_impact": evaluate_limitation_impact(fallback_session),
        "recovery_success": track_recovery_attempts(fallback_session)
    }
    
    # Log fallback performance for improvement
    fallback_memory = {
        "type": "fallback_performance",
        "fallback_persona": fallback_session.persona_name,
        "original_request": fallback_session.original_request,
        "session_duration": fallback_session.duration,
        "quality_metrics": quality_metrics,
        "improvement_suggestions": generate_improvement_suggestions(quality_metrics)
    }
    
    # Store for future fallback optimization
    if memory_system_available():
        add_memories(
            content=json.dumps(fallback_memory),
            tags=["fallback", "performance", fallback_session.persona_name],
            metadata={"type": "fallback_analysis"}
        )
```

## Fallback Improvement Learning
```python
def learn_from_fallback_usage():
    # Analyze fallback usage patterns
    fallback_memories = search_memory(
        "fallback_performance effectiveness user_satisfaction",
        limit=20,
        threshold=0.5
    )
    
    insights = {
        "most_effective_fallbacks": identify_effective_fallbacks(fallback_memories),
        "common_limitation_complaints": extract_limitation_issues(fallback_memories),
        "successful_workarounds": find_successful_workarounds(fallback_memories),
        "recovery_pattern_success": analyze_recovery_patterns(fallback_memories)
    }
    
    # Update fallback personas based on learnings
    for insight in insights.improvement_opportunities:
        update_fallback_persona(insight.persona, insight.improvements)
    
    return insights
```

This fallback persona system ensures that BMAD can continue operating with reduced but functional capabilities even when primary persona files are unavailable, while continuously learning to improve the fallback experience.

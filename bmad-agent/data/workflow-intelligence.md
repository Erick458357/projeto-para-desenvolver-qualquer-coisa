# Workflow Intelligence Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This file contains accumulated workflow intelligence and patterns learned from successful BMAD method applications across projects.

## Workflow Patterns

### Successful MVP Development Pattern
- **Pattern**: Analyst → PM → Architect → Design Architect → PO → SM → Dev
- **Success Rate**: 85%
- **Key Success Factors**:
  - Clear project brief before PRD
  - Architecture validation before development
  - Story preparation with full context
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Skipping architecture review
  - Incomplete story context
  - Missing quality gates

### Feature Addition Pattern
- **Pattern**: PM → Architect → SM → Dev
- **Success Rate**: 90%
- **Key Success Factors**:
  - Focused scope definition
  - Architecture impact assessment
  - Clear acceptance criteria
- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - Scope creep
  - Missing integration considerations

## Decision Points

### When to Use Analyst
- New project without clear direction
- Market research needed
- Complex problem space exploration

### When to Skip Analyst
- Clear feature additions
- Well-defined technical tasks
- Existing project with established direction

## Optimization Opportunities

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Design Architect can work on UI/UX while Architect designs backend
- PO can validate documentation while SM prepares stories
- Multiple dev agents can work on independent stories

### Common Bottlenecks
- Architecture review delays
- Story context preparation
- Quality gate validations

## Integration Patterns

### Memory Integration
- Search for similar project patterns before starting
- Store successful workflow sequences
- Learn from project-specific optimizations

### Quality Integration
- UDTM analysis at major decision points
- Brotherhood reviews before phase transitions
- Anti-pattern detection throughout workflow

## Note
This is a placeholder file for future workflow intelligence accumulation. As the BMAD method is used, workflow patterns, optimization opportunities, and decision heuristics will be captured here.
